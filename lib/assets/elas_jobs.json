They collect data from edge servers, and are used to power application monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, and network monitoring. We currently have five official Beats: Filebeat for gathering logs, Packetbeat for network traffic, Metricbeat for metrics, Winlogbeat for Windows event logs, Heartbeat for uptime monitoring, and Auditbeat for audit data. In addition, the open-source community has created over 40 Beats, collecting data from all sorts of sources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All current Beats are written in Golang.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of the Beats team, you will be responsible for maintaining the official Beats, for creating new ones, as well as for supporting the community around Beats.
