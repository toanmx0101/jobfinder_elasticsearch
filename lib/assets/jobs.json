I mean, really enjoy thinking about them and putting new ideas forward. Do you live and breathe entertainment? Do you read or watch media coverage on a network, executive or television series and get curious about how it came to be and wonder how it could be improved? Do you thrive in a fast-paced environment? If so, we may have just the opportunity for the right person on the originals publicity team. The OpportunityFueled by the broad appeal of being able to instantly enjoy unlimited movies and TV shows, Netflix has grown to more than 117 million streaming members in over 190 countries. This is the total package -- a great opportunity to join a team that is spearheading and handling communications and publicity campaigns for a fast-growing and highly admired company, across overall strategy and messaging, series publicity, executive communications, appearances and crisis management.  And you’ll get to work with some of the most exciting and creative people in the business. The RoleThe Manager of Global Publicity and Content Communications will work in conjunction with the LA publicity leadership team to primarily help set and implement communications strategy and craft messaging for content teams and executives, while also managing executive appearances and crisis communications. She or he also will be responsible for series publicity initiatives, as well as trade/consumer press announcements.The Manager will have past experience in helping create, shape, execute and manage entertainment trade/consumer communications strategy, both on the corporate/executive side and the series campaign side. They will have experience in communicating with executives, filmmakers, talent and production company partners. She or he will have exemplary media relations, particularly with trade/industry press in both Los Angeles and New York.  They can skillfully and thoughtfully craft narratives, boil down complex concepts into succinct pitches and secure and work with media across broadcast, print, online and radio in both the trade and consumer space. International experience or knowledge of international media is a bonus. They have also worked alongside agencies, or have managed agencies or consultants on projects. They can formulate and manage a budget, and give visibility into their process successfully. The ideal candidate is able to make wise decisions, even when faced with ambiguity, and thinks strategically at all times. He/she is not defined by past experiences and is eager to put a new spin on what publicity can be. They can articulate what they are - and are not - trying to do. He or she is a good listener and a real doer, and is able to multitask and work at a clip pace. They are not afraid to get their hands dirty - and that could mean jumping in to handle tasks that range from writing a strategy, writing a series announcement, or helping cover a set visit, if necessary. We are a small team, so the responsibility really is wide-ranging. They collaborate well with partners that range from content/programming to marketing to social to product and beyond. Strong candidates can handle a vast amount of work and they are eager to learn. They are curious and also contribute effectively outside of their speciality. A good fit in the role has a candid and direct communication style, they are willing to admit to mistakes quickly and questions values inconsistent with our values and Netflix culture. They understand that sometimes the job requires delivering bad news, and they’re tactful in handling such issues.QualificationsThe successful candidate for Manager, Global Publicity and Content Communications will have at least 7+ years of entertainment experience in a studio, network, agency or journalism setting.Background in Communications/Corporate Communications preferred.  They have relationships with key media as well as the ability to build and maintain connections with key journalists and social media influencers.  BA/BS required.COMPENSATIONNetflix offers an attractive compensation package consisting of base salary, stock options, 401K (with match), comprehensive benefits and relocation.REPORTING RELATIONSHIPThe Manager, Global Publicity and Content Communications reports to the Director of Global Publicity and Content Communications. \n",

Do you thrive in a fast-paced environment? If so, we may have just the opportunity for the right person on the originals publicity team. The <br><br><br><b>Opportunity</b><br>Fueled by the broad appeal of being able to instantly enjoy unlimited movies and TV shows, Netflix has grown to more than 117 million streaming members in over 190 countries. This is the total package -- a great opportunity to join a team that is spearheading and handling communications and publicity campaigns for a fast-growing and highly admired company, across overall strategy and messaging, series publicity, executive communications, appearances and crisis management. &nbsp;And you’ll get to work with some of the most exciting and creative people in the business. <br><br><br><b>The Role</b><br>The Manager of Global Publicity and Content Communications will work in conjunction with the LA publicity leadership team to primarily help set and implement communications strategy and craft messaging for content teams and executives, while also managing executive appearances and crisis communications. She or he also will be responsible for series publicity initiatives, as well as trade/consumer press announcements.<br><br><br>The Manager will have past experience in helping create, shape, execute and manage entertainment trade/consumer communications strategy, both on the corporate/executive side and the series campaign side. They will have experience in communicating with executives, filmmakers, talent and production company partners. She or he will have exemplary media relations, particularly with trade/industry press in both Los Angeles and New York. &nbsp;They can skillfully and thoughtfully craft narratives, boil down complex concepts into succinct pitches and secure and work with media across broadcast, print, online and radio in both the trade and consumer space. International experience or knowledge of international media is a bonus. They have also worked alongside agencies, or have managed agencies or consultants on projects. They can formulate and manage a budget, and give visibility into their process successfully. <br><br><br>The ideal candidate is able to make wise decisions, even when faced with ambiguity, and thinks strategically at all times. He/she is not defined by past experiences and is eager to put a new spin on what publicity can be. They can articulate what they are - and are not - trying to do. He or she is a good listener and a real doer, and is able to multitask and work at a clip pace. They are not afraid to get their hands dirty - and that could mean jumping in to handle tasks that range from writing a strategy, writing a series announcement, or helping cover a set visit, if necessary. We are a small team, so the responsibility really is wide-ranging. They collaborate well with partners that range from content/programming to marketing to social to product and beyond. Strong candidates can handle a vast amount of work and they are eager to learn. They are curious and also contribute effectively outside of their speciality. A good fit in the role has a candid and direct communication style, they are willing to admit to mistakes quickly and questions values inconsistent with our values and Netflix culture. They understand that sometimes the job requires delivering bad news, and they’re tactful in handling such issues.<br><br><br><b>Qualifications</b><br>The successful candidate for Manager, Global Publicity and Content Communications will have at least 7+ years of entertainment experience in a studio, network, agency or journalism setting.Background in Communications/Corporate Communications preferred. &nbsp;They have relationships with key media as well as the ability to build and maintain connections with key journalists and social media influencers. &nbsp;BA/BS required.<br><br><br><b>COMPENSATION</b><br>Netflix offers an attractive compensation package consisting of base salary, stock options, 401K (with match), comprehensive benefits and relocation.<br><br><br><b>REPORTING RELATIONSHIP</b><br>The Manager, Global Publicity and Content Communications reports to the Director of Global Publicity and Content Communications. <br><br><br><br></p>\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n ",

From David Fincher’s MINDHUNTER to stand-up icon Dave Chappelle, to David Ayer and Will Smith’s Bright to Bryan Fogel’s Icarus, we are looking for someone who has experience working with talent, rapidly consumes entertainment, and is passionate and curious about the growing global entertainment landscape. This person should be excited to grow Netflix into the best place for talent to work in our industry.The OpportunityFueled by the broad appeal of being able to instantly enjoy unlimited movies and TV shows, Netflix has grown to have over 117 million streaming members in over 190 countries. This is a great opportunity to join a team that is building the largest Internet entertainment service  in the world, with a chance to work with the brightest filmmakers and actors around the world, using the latest technology.  The RoleAs a member of a seasoned group of professionals based in the Hollywood office, the Manager of Talent Relations will be responsible for creating invite lists for our talent driven premieres, driving talent strategy around executive honors and tributes, and organizing/facilitating ticketing for awards ceremonies for nominees and internal executives.  We want to be the premier entertainment industry destination for talent and as such, will work closely with our colleagues across content, marketing and communications, across all content programming genres, to establish best practices and innovate how we organize, prioritize and work with talent and their representatives.  As one of the first points of contact for talent and their reps within Netflix, this role will act as a brand and business ambassador, helping to ensure our talent become part of the fabric of their shows, films, and promotional efforts.  The ideal candidate exhibits consistent sound judgement and maturity in business communications and decision making, even when faced with ambiguity.   He or she is polished, personable, a heightened listener, a real doer, adept at reading a room, and is able to multi-task and work efficiently, independently and with speed.

They are willing to admit to mistakes quickly and question values inconsistent with our values and Netflix culture. They understand that sometimes the job requires delivering bad news, and they’re tactful in handling such issues.  Talent relations is not a 9 to 5 job and will require willingness to work evenings and on weekend.  International travel also required. QualificationsThe successful candidate will have at 5-7 years of entertainment experience in an agency, studio, network, production or journalism setting. They have worked directly and successfully with talent have relationships with talent representatives.  The ideal candidate is high energy, motivated with strong relationship-building capabilities and a capacity to work in a very fast-paced environment.  BA/BS required.To succeed at Netflix, the candidate must also possess the following characteristics:CreativeDemonstrated ability to think innovatively—connecting the dots when others cannot. Able to make the leap from information to insight. Able to identify, nurture and help refine compelling creative ideas and concepts.Succinct CommunicatorGreat writer and clear talker.

From David Fincher’s MINDHUNTER to stand-up icon Dave Chappelle, to David Ayer and Will Smith’s Bright to Bryan Fogel’s Icarus, we are looking for someone who has experience working with talent, rapidly consumes entertainment, and is passionate and curious about the growing global entertainment landscape. This person should be excited to grow Netflix into the best place for talent to work in our industry.<br><br><br><b>The Opportunity</b><br>Fueled by the broad appeal of being able to instantly enjoy unlimited movies and TV shows, Netflix has grown to have over 117 million streaming members in over 190 countries. This is a great opportunity to join a team that is building the largest Internet entertainment service &nbsp;in the world, with a chance to work with the brightest filmmakers and actors around the world, using the latest technology. &nbsp;<br><br><br><b>The Role</b><br>As a member of a seasoned group of professionals based in the Hollywood office, the Manager of Talent Relations will be responsible for creating invite lists for our talent driven premieres, driving talent strategy around executive honors and tributes, and organizing/facilitating ticketing for awards ceremonies for nominees and internal executives. &nbsp;We want to be the premier entertainment industry destination for talent and as such, will work closely with our colleagues across content, marketing and communications, across all content programming genres, to establish best practices and innovate how we organize, prioritize and work with talent and their representatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the first points of contact for talent and their reps within Netflix, this role will act as a brand and business ambassador, helping to ensure our talent become part of the fabric of their shows, films, and promotional efforts. &nbsp;<br><br><br>The ideal candidate exhibits consistent sound judgement and maturity in business communications and decision making, even when faced with ambiguity. &nbsp;&nbsp;He or she is polished, personable, a heightened listener, a real doer, adept at reading a room, and is able to multi-task and work efficiently, independently and with speed. They are not afraid to get their hands dirty - and that could mean jumping in to handle tasks that range from writing a strategy, creating lists, coordinating gifts, booking travel, or negotiating hair and make-up. They collaborate well with partners that range from content/programming to marketing to social to product and beyond. Strong candidates can handle a vast amount of work and they are eager to learn. They are curious and also contribute effectively outside of their speciality. They aren’t timid about assessing their work when they are done to explore what they could have done differently or better. &nbsp;A good fit in the role has a candid and direct communication style. They are willing to admit to mistakes quickly and question values inconsistent with our values and Netflix culture. They understand that sometimes the job requires delivering bad news, and they’re tactful in handling such issues. &nbsp;Talent relations is not a 9 to 5 job and will require willingness to work evenings and on weekend. &nbsp;International travel also required. <br><br><br><b>Qualifications</b><br>The successful candidate will have at 5-7 years of entertainment experience in an agency, studio, network, production or journalism setting. They have worked directly and successfully with talent have relationships with talent representatives. &nbsp;The ideal candidate is high energy, motivated with strong relationship-building capabilities and a capacity to work in a very fast-paced environment. &nbsp;BA/BS required.<br><br><br>To succeed at Netflix, the candidate must also possess the following characteristics:<br><br><br><b>Creative</b><br>Demonstrated ability to think innovatively—connecting the dots when others cannot. Able to make the leap from information to insight. Able to identify, nurture and help refine compelling creative ideas and concepts.<br><br><br><b>Succinct Communicator</b><br>Great writer and clear talker. Can organize, summarize, clarify and communicate ideas simply, succinctly and accurately. Has a quick intelligence, is fast on the feet and quickly responds to issues and questions. Says it like it is; not wrapped in political niceties.<br><br><br><b>Pragmatic, Organized and Detailed</b><br>Has a big capacity to both think and ‘do’.

It’s because new ideas are constantly being explored across all aspects of the Netflix product, including our UI experience, recommendation/search algorithms, sign-up flows, messaging, adaptive streaming algorithms, etc. To ensure that these ideas deliver experiences our subscribers love, we diligently test and measure the impact of all these proposed enhancements using ABlaze, Netflix’s Experimentation Platform.  Given the size and complexity of our datasets, this analysis is no trivial task. Our platform must process data for A/B test analysis across 100M+ subscribers and over 100M+ hours of video streamed every day. Our current infrastructure has served us well, but now that Netflix is in almost every country around the world, it’s time to evolve and scale.Consequently, we’re re-architecting our data pipelines to provide our users with more flexible self-serve experimentation analysis capabilities. This means allowing them to specify their own data sources, metrics, dimensions, and statistical tests, and finally choose from a variety of data visualization options in order to construct reusable reports for each experimentation area.Since almost every product decision at Netflix depends on A/B test analysis, your efforts on this team will impact improvements throughout our product and therefore the experience of the millions of our users across the globe.\n",

To bring joy to global audiences, we need truly global content.  That doesn’t always come from Hollywood.  So our content legal team is in search of an experienced IP attorney in Europe to handle a wide range of IP issues that arise from the creation of Netflix original content across Europe.  In this position, working from Amsterdam or London, you will be the first Content IP lawyer outside of Los Angeles with a unique opportunity to launch (and eventually build!) a nimble team that will take the lead in Europe on things like rights acquisition, copyright, chain-of-title, title clearance, production clearance of content, IP enforcement, IP claims defense, moral rights, defamation, and trademarks.  This role will closely collaborate with the creative, business, marketing and other legal teams that work together to create Netflix’s great content. As a seasoned entertainment IP attorney, the breadth of your experience enables you to handle any situation that may be encountered on a production. You’ve seen it all and aren’t phased by the last minute surprises that inevitably arise when developing, shooting, or marketing a film, series or documentary.  You expertly navigate those situations while allowing your studio colleagues to fulfill their creative and business goals. You understand the dynamics among showrunners, executive producers, line producers, finance, post-production, marketing and creative, and know when and how to align the appropriate teams when IP issue arise. You’re comfortable evaluating risk with imperfect information and have the confidence to make quick decisions.  Your expert eye for detail and exceptional organizational talents mean that you are able to improve upon systems to gain efficiency. You are passionate about the entertainment industry and are excited to learn more about the business from a non-traditional perspective.  Above all, you have an opinion and are willing to voice it. The successful candidate will love working in an environment where freedom, responsibility, and curiosity are mandates.  That candidate will also thrive in an workplace that values thoughtful efficiency more than process, and innovation more than convention.The role will report to Senior Counsel, Content and Brand IP based in Los Angeles.  Frequent travel throughout Europe will be required, in addition to quarterly travel to California.\n",

        "description": "At Netflix, we are shaping the future of entertainment because we believe there is a better way to watch.  Our international efforts have brought Netflix around the globe to virtually all countries and we’re excited to bring even more of our Originals programming to our viewers.   With over 100 Million subscribers enjoying great content in over 190 countries, it's an exciting time to work at Netflix.  Netflix seeks an experienced Music Contract Administrator to help support our expanding slate of Originals content (Series, Film, Documentary, Comedy, Unscripted and Kids programming).  This role will have broad responsibility for managing the tracking, organization, distribution and processing of a high volume of contracts for the Music Team, from signature to distribution,  archiving, processing and arranging for payment. This is not your traditional Contract Administrator role:  you will manage vital components of our music contract administration process, not just “contract management,” and have visibility into all facets of our music business and the larger scope of Netflix’s expansion.   If this sounds intriguing, read on for the details...As a seasoned Music Contract Administrator, you know the ins-and-outs of the music industry, and its jargon is second nature to you. You know exactly what it takes to use music in a production, you understand the significance of master use and synchronization licenses and you know what a composer agreement and music supervisor agreement covers.  Your organizational skills are unparalleled and in your view, there’s no contract detail that’s too small or insignificant.  Your expert eye for detail means you know how to review music agreements (be they master use or synchronization licenses, composer agreements, music supervisor agreements, producer or songwriter agreements) for the key information needed for contract administration purposes, and flag any critical information that’s missing.    Your  organization talents mean that you’re not fazed by a high volume of contracts and, in fact, you seek a role that provides an opportunity to learn more about the business and to take on more than traditional contract management responsibilities, with a strong voice in shaping our contract management systems.  If so far this sounds not only undaunting, but exciting, this is the role you’ve been looking for. The successful candidate will be one who seeks out these values.  He or she thrives in an environment where freedom and responsibility are a tenet, and passion, innovation and curiosity are mandates.

        "description": "At Netflix, we are shaping the future of entertainment because we believe there is a better way to watch.  Our international efforts have brought Netflix around the globe to virtually all countries and we’re excited to bring even more of our Originals programming to our viewers.  With over 100 Million subscribers enjoying great content in over 190 countries, it's an exciting time to work at Netflix.  Netflix seeks an experienced Cue Sheet Specialist to help support our expanding slate of Originals content and music repertoire.  In this unique and exciting role, you will have visibility into all facets of our music business, with responsibility over vital components of our music cue sheet and music administration processes.  As a cue sheet expert, you know exactly what it takes to use music in a production and you understand the significance of synchronization licenses, publishing splits and PRO information.  You have mastered the art of cue sheet preparation and in your view, there is no cue sheet data that is too small or insignificant.  You know the difference between CISAC and SESAC, a PRO and CMO.  You know how to review composer and license agreements for pertinent cue sheet information and are effective in aligning music supervisors, music editors and other production personnel to deliver proper cue sheet data and oversee timely and accurate cue sheet creation and delivery.    Your thorough understanding of why cue sheets matter results in a keen attention to detail and accuracy that you impart to everyone involved in the music production process.  On your watch, it is not acceptable for splits to add up to less or more than 100%, for PRO information to be lacking, or for timing or publisher fields to be incomplete or incorrect.  Any discrepancies do not last long as you are the first to spot them and solve them.  While you may be an expert at Rapid Cue and other automated cue sheet systems and know who to contact at the PROs to discuss cue sheet matters, your command of this area means you have also identified ways that cue sheet creation and delivery can be improved.  In this role you would be able to actively contribute to cue sheet innovation and help shape our cue sheet administration and delivery strategy. The successful candidate will be one who seeks out these values.  He or she thrives in an environment where freedom and responsibility are a tenet, and passion, innovation and curiosity are mandates.  He or she places thoughtful efficiency over process yet knows how to work with organizations or institutions who may not hold the same beliefs. This role is based in Netflix's Los Angeles office and reports to the Coordinator, Music and Cue Sheet Administration of the Music Group, part of the Business &amp; Legal Affairs team at Netflix.   The Music Group is based in Los Angeles, London and Berlin and is responsible for all of Netflix’s global music business and strategy, from the production and licensing of Netflix Originals through to the distribution of the Netflix service globally.\n",

The social manager role at Netflix is a blend of strategy and creative, responsible for launching social campaigns that get people so excited for the Netflix brand and original titles that they sign up. From a strategy standpoint, the manager will need to understand Hong Kong and Taiwan markets, our broad Netflix business goals, and local social behavior to lay out what it will take to win the word of mouth game in one of our newest and most important growth markets. The successful candidate will display the curiosity to learn the Netflix business, analyze high volumes of information quickly, and make smart choices.

You will have a great opportunity to represent the local context and help many colleagues from content, product and marketing approach the market with confidence. Creatively, our goal on the marketing team is to build campaigns that prioritize earned media and social conversation. With our original titles and a strong brand, we try to earn as many impressions as we can get before buying them. The Hong Kong and Taiwan social leader will manage an agency, develop creative, and even work with talent from time to time. He or she will need to have impeccable taste, vision for how to stand out from the competition, and a strong instinct for ideas that will get consumers talking.

We work in a fast-moving environment like a newsroom, constantly mining conversation for insights and ideas, and shaping how consumers and media think about us.A little bit about the team:-With social managers from nearly every major country around the world, we’re a bit like the UN of social media-We love a good pun-We aren’t afraid to get our hands dirty and don’t think community management is a dirty word-We have a head for business. We understand working in a corporate context even though we find ways to bring our personality to work-We love movies and TV and could talk about it for hours. We keep a running spreadsheet on Making a Murderer theories, share lists of our favorite TV episodes of the year, and sometimes go to the movies togetherThe manager will have 7+ years of experience with some combination of consumer brand, media, entertainment, and agency work in marketing and communications.

        "description": "About the OpportunityNetflix is enjoyed by over 100 million members around the world who, in aggregate, watch more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies every day.  The product experience is delivered on 1000+ different device types calling into a complex distributed system of services running in the cloud.  One result of all of this usage is data.  Lots of data. We are looking for a seasoned distributed systems engineer to help us develop, extend, and scale Mantis, our mission-critical stream processing engine that provides rich, real-time operational insights and other key metrics.  Mantis is used extensively by a breadth of Netflix engineering teams to help us detect operational and functional failures throughout the Netflix architecture that could be affecting the customer experience.  We also use Mantis to trigger alerts and remediations for such failures.  With respect to “lots of data”, Mantis currently processes over one trillion events per day, every day. About the RoleAs a Distributed Systems Engineer on the Mantis team you will have the freedom to design, build and extend the Mantis platform as well as building out analytics capabilities through streaming machine learning components. You'll also be responsible for operating Mantis as a critical service for other Edge teams and Netflix as a whole. About the TeamThe team is part of the Edge Engineering organization where most of the tier-1 critical services reside within Netflix.

If you’re the kind of person who wants to change how global viewers experience TV and movies, is passionate about how consumers behave online, follows the tech firms, and loves movies and TV, then perhaps you’ll take the crown. This is a management position. The Director will lead a team of Netflix employees and agency partners, and will need to inspire our highly skilled group of social experts to perform their best. We’re seeking an individual with a high EQ, who can navigate the intersection of Netflix and Japanese business cultures. It will require strong partnership and collaboration with other Japan and California based leaders in marketing and comms, biz dev, product, and content. The role reports to the VP of Global Social Media.The successful candidate will show the curiosity to learn about the Netflix business quickly to ensure campaigns impact the business goals in one of our newest and most important growth markets. The right leader will guide the team as they build the social conversation amid a rapidly changing entertainment landscape - and a tricky social media market - establishing the SVOD category, creating word of mouth, attracting new members, and building the brand reputation.It’s also a highly creative role. We believe that the power of an endorsed impression is more valuable than a paid advertisement, and we work to earn as many impressions as possible before buying them. The Director will work closely with the regional leaders and agencies to make a broad set of Netflix original titles as shareable as possible in the Japanese market, creating cultural phenomena and igniting fan behavior in the process. The Director will need to have impeccable creative taste, vision, and a strong instinct for stories that will get consumers talking.The right hire will bring a deep knowledge of the social media landscape, including strong relationships with social media platforms and understanding the new consumer behaviors emerging everyday. In particular, the person will need to innovate and push the envelope when it comes to entertainment campaigns in Japan. The Director will have 10 years’ experience with some combination of consumer brand, media, entertainment, and agency work in marketing and communications, and several years experience managing a team.If all of the above sounds like your cup of tea, the Netflix culture attracts daredevils who exhibit good judgment, innovation, selflessness, courage, impact, candid communication, passion, and curiosity.

But you do… Encoding artifacts pull you out of your favorite scenes. In fact, people don’t like watching movies with you, because you’re guilty of pausing just to complain about 100 ms of A/V sync drift or lifted blacks on your friend’s television - and yet you secretly revel in the splendor of a broken GOP, when the subject of one sequence blends into the movement of another, and creates something fantastic that will only exist in that moment and maybe never again. You are one of us. We have been looking for you. We advocate for new customer experiences including more numerous and vibrant pixels, better accessibility and subtitle features. New video experiences like 4K, High Dynamic Range and Wide Color Gamuts create new challenges in every step of our encoding process, from content mastering at the studio level to streaming playback on consumer devices. We provide expertise and certification materials to nearly all engineering teams at Netflix who interact with our encoding pipeline; we also engage with external partners to ensure conformance and define standards or best practices.  We are actively involved in communities like SMPTE and W3C, defining next-generation media formats that include the features necessary for unprecedented video streaming quality on a global scale. As the company scales up studio productions, and continues to revolutionize the way stories are told, we will power the video processing, color management and transcoding applications that bring scalability and reliability to Hollywood.  The ideal Senior Video Engineer is 50% film geek with engineering experience in post-production and/or the visual effects space, and 50% computer nerd with practical experience in application development, preferably in the cloud.\n",
